      <title>spotymenu: control spotify via dmenu</title>

      <description>I while ago it became a pain in the ass for me to select and arrange albums with Spotify&amp;rsquo;s GUI. It&amp;rsquo;s slow, feels heavy and bloated. I wanted something quicker and easier to use, especially something what I can control with the keyboard. I know there is mopidy-spotify and other libspotify based applications too, but those work only with premium accounts. I&amp;rsquo;ve found a bunch of scripts, but those only do basic Spotify controls via dbus (play/pause, prev/next etc.).</description>

      <description>If you are using dmenu, you might want to run terminal applications from it. I&amp;rsquo;ve found an old post about a modified dmenu_run script in the Arch Linux Forums, in the Dmenu Hacking Thread: #45. It worked fine, but I&amp;rsquo;m using urxvt with .Xresources color definitions for some apps. So I modded that script a bit to use the .Xresources name when it&amp;rsquo;s given. For that to work, you need to create list with the names of the apps in ~/.dmenu_term_apps, for example: $cat ~/.dmenu_term_apps htop alsamixer ranger -name ranger mocp -name moc newsbeuter -name newsbeuter rtorrent -name rTorrent If the -name &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; was given, the app will use its own Xresources settings, otherwise it will use the default settings.</description>

      <title>dmenu2 modding</title>
      <link>http://spcmd.github.io/2016/02/24/dmenu2-modding/</link>

      <description>About a month ago I started using dmenu (dmenu2, precisely), but I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the behaviour of the TAB key (completion). I wanted it to behave like Vimperator: TAB key to select the next element, Shift+TAB to select the previous. So I modified the dmenu.c file in the source and now it works the way I wanted. If you like this TAB behaviour better, you can get this modified version from my dmenu2 repository.</description>

      <title>urxvt url-select-plus</title>
      <link>http://spcmd.github.io/2016/02/24/urxvt-url-select-plus/</link>

      <description>For urxvt there is a nice perl extension called url-select, written by Bert Muennich. It was fine until I needed a few more options, especially an option for opening the selected url in an alternative browser. So I made a slight modification: added an option for it, then added another option for opening the selected url with a media player, which is useful for youtube or some other video links. I renamed this modified script to url-select-plus to avoid naming conflicts.</description>

      <description>Long time since I updated this blog, if you read this, it means I&amp;rsquo;ve just successfully migrated from jekyllrb to Hugo. The migration wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t super easy either. I had a few bumps, I had to read the documentation apparently, but so far I like it. I also cleaned up a bit, removed some old, obsolete posts. I hope I can write some new, helpful/useful post in the near future.</description>

      <title>Fix: Acer Laptop freezes with Arch Linux and other systemd based distros</title>

      <description>I had a problem with Arch-based (or systemd based?) distros with my Acer ES1-512 laptop. Every time I used systemctl suspend or pm-suspend the whole system just totally froze. Shutdown didn&amp;rsquo;t work either: the system was shut down, but the laptop didn&amp;rsquo;t turn off (screen backlight was on, and the fans were working too). I tried a bunch of kernels, systemd versions, different kernel parameters, but neither of them worked. A week ago I installed Arch again and played around with the BIOS settings (again).</description>

      <description>Vimpv is a javascript plugin for Vimperator which allows you to follow/open video urls with mpv. Tested on Youtube and Vimeo. Usage: The default key map is ;m You can map the default key to something else, for example, if you don&amp;rsquo;t use the mark command, you can map it to m in your ~/.vimperatorrc: nmap m ;m You can find the plugin in my dotfiles repo: https://github.com/spcmd/dotfiles/blob/master/vimperator/.vimperator/plugin/vimpv.js</description>

      <title>Vim Easy TODO</title>

      <description>Today I released my very first Vim plugin called Vim Easy TODO. I&amp;rsquo;m using Vim for about 3 weeks now, and I like it a lot. I still have a lot to learn, but I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it. I needed some To-do list plugin like PlainTasks for Sublime Text. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use some &amp;ldquo;heavy&amp;rdquo; plugin, I just needed to have some basic, formatted/colorized To-do list. So I decided to write it for myself.</description>
