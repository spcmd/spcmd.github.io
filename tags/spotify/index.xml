      <description>I while ago it became a pain in the ass for me to select and arrange albums with Spotify&amp;rsquo;s GUI. It&amp;rsquo;s slow, feels heavy and bloated. I wanted something quicker and easier to use, especially something what I can control with the keyboard. I know there is mopidy-spotify and other libspotify based applications too, but those work only with premium accounts. I&amp;rsquo;ve found a bunch of scripts, but those only do basic Spotify controls via dbus (play/pause, prev/next etc.).</description>
