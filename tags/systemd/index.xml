      <description>I had a problem with Arch-based (or systemd based?) distros with my Acer ES1-512 laptop. Every time I used systemctl suspend or pm-suspend the whole system just totally froze. Shutdown didn&amp;rsquo;t work either: the system was shut down, but the laptop didn&amp;rsquo;t turn off (screen backlight was on, and the fans were working too). I tried a bunch of kernels, systemd versions, different kernel parameters, but neither of them worked. A week ago I installed Arch again and played around with the BIOS settings (again).</description>
